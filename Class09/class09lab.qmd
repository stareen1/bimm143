# 1: Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

## PDB statistics

We are moving the CSV file into RStudio and reading it using `read.csv`.

```{r}
url <- "Data Export Summary.csv"
pdb.data <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1)
pdb.data
```

> **Q1:** What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.
>
> I need to sum all the elements of the X.ray column.

```{r}
# R is understanding that these are letters because there are commas
pdb.data$X.ray
```

We are going to use `gsub` to remove the commas. Then we can convert to numbers.

```{r}
#replace the commas with nothing (empty string)
xray.n <- as.numeric(gsub(",", '', pdb.data$X.ray))

em.n <- as.numeric(gsub(",", '', pdb.data$EM))

total.n <- as.numeric(gsub(",", '', pdb.data$Total))
```

Now we can get the sums of each row to find the percentage.

```{r}
(sum(xray.n) + sum(em.n))/sum(total.n) * 100
```

93% of the structures in the PDB are solved by X-ray and Electron Microscopy.

> **Q2:** What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",", '', pdb.data[1,7]))/sum(total.n)
```

87% of the structures in the PDB are protein.

> **Q3:** Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
>
> Maybe, there are 2003 HIV-1 protease structures in the PDB.

# 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

## Using Mol\*

> **Q4**: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?
>
> The PDB viewer only shows the main atom in a molecule which is oxygen for water.
>
> **Q5**: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have
>
> The critical water molecule that binds to the ligand is number 308.
>
> **Q6**: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend *"Ball & Stick"* for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

# 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

> **Q7:** How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?
>
> There are 198.
>
> **Q8:** Name one of the two non-protein residues?
>
> One of them is HOH 127.
>
> **Q9:** How many protein chains are in this structure?
>
> There are 2.

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure by NMA

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb('6s36')
```

```{r}
adk
```

```{r}
#normal mode analysis to see the flexibility of the protein
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
#check what type of class m is
class(m)

#class nma objects have their own type of plot
#fluctuations tells us the flexibility of each amino acid
plot(m)
```

It would be nice to see this in 3D...

```{r}
#this will create a new file
mktrj(m, file = "adk_m7.pdb")
```
